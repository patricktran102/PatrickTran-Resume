        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Patrick Tran and I attend the University of California, Riverside currently for as an undergraduate and as a Chemistry Major. My professional accomplishments include working as a barista at Ding Tea, a major drink franchise across the world, working at Ross as a stock manager, a major clothing retailer in the United States. I also have interned at two cultural clubs on campus at the University of California, Riverside which were the Vietnamese Student Association and the Nikkei Student Union.
<br><br>

        My career goal, at the moment, is to become a physician.  I recently applied to become a COPE Health Scholar so that I could gain experience interacting with patients and also learn about the other specialties and jobs within a hospital so that I can truly solidify what my career goal is. I also recently was a stock manager at Ross and later a barista at Ding Tea. I decided to do a retail job so that I could improve my communication and customer service skills. Although I did end up improving my customer service skills, my communication skills had yet to be improved. Most of my coworkers at Ross were older, average age being 60, so I ended up doing most of the work since most of the time the other stock workers were physically incapable and subsequently I wasnâ€™t able to communicate much with them. In order to improve my communication skills, I decided to work at Ding Tea, an environment where I was constantly communicating with my coworkers in high pressure and fast paced situations. Working at both these places helped me gain valuable skills I can use to attain my career goal. 
<br><br>

        I have gained many skills regarding my jobs that I have worked at; Ross, Ding Tea, and Riverside Community Hospital. My skills include strategic and financial planning, cost control and reduction, team management and task delegation, experience using Microsoft and Google applications, planning and execution, guest and food service, well experienced in working in high pressure and fast paced environments, stock and merchandise management, patient interactions, and working with medical practitioners with proficient use of medical terminology. I also held a board position in a club called KIWINâ€™S, a volunteering club dedicated to raising money for foundations and helping the community. I was the treasurer during this time, and I drafted monthly treasury reports to support management decision-making needs, helped raise $2200 for the club funds and multiple charity organizations, and advised management regarding significant expenditures to keep operations in line with budget limitations. During my time at Ding Tea as a barista I memorized over 75+ drink and cooking recipes and in charge of sanitization of work, cooking, and cleaning equipment, accurately processed customer transactions and responsible for cash drawer, and restocked, arranged, and organized drink and food supplies to efficiently improve workflow and cleanliness.  During my time at Ross I gained much experience in communicating with workers and am also well versed in talking to customers, and I restocked, arranged, and organized merchandise in front lanes to drive product sales. I am also the Vice President of the Illerside B-boy & B-girl club at the University of California, Riverside. A club where we teach and perform breakdancing styles and routines, during my time as Vice President, Iâ€™ve learnt how to assist the President in responsibilities, and oversee responsibilities of Chapter Executive Board members.
